# slack-thread-replay

Slack App that aims to replay a specific thread as an IM to the requested user. Designed for cases where users are chatting about an event live with other users in a Slack thread. 

For other users who missed the event live but still want to have the live commentary as they watch, the Slack App will replay the threaded comments in "real time" as an IM to that user.
